## Description
Link to deployed application: https://madisonailani.github.io/password-generator/

I built this project in order to have a password generator on hand. It is important to have one of these because common passwords are easy to guess and can leave you vulnerable to cyber attacks. With a randomly generated password, you don't have to worry about someone being able to guess it easily. While doing this project, I learned about do/while loops and their functionality. I also got better at functions in javascript.

From here, you have to answer the alerts and the password will be displayed in the box.
